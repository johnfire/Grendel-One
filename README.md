# Grendel One
Robot and artificual intellegence project.

this project uses raspberry pis in a cluster setup as the brain, an old meccano set as the basic physical structure of the robot/AI and commerical parts such as servo motors for  model airplanes where needed. currently, as of 20 sept 2015 its basically a shell program and  a head, but that is in creassing quickly. 

the program is divided into objects based on functional areas, for  example senses controls its sensing apparatus, movement controls servos etc , investigate allows it to makee recursive decisions when exploring something etc.
